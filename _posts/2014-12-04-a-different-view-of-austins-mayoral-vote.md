I’m tired of looking at the Chronicle’s [depressing election results map](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2014-11-21/10-1-ticker-run-off-endorsements/). Sure, by precinct, Austin may indeed be a city divided by race and class. But we know that’s not true! Well, not to the extent that the precinct map would have us believe, at least.

So here’s a dot density map (click for high-res), with one dot for each person that voted for Adler or Martinez in Travis County. Not pictured: the 90,000+ voters who voted for another candidate, or no one at all.

See you at the polls!
