Spatial Austin is alive!

Henceforth, this little corner of the internet will be dedicated to thinking about and mapping all things spatial in Austin, Texas. To that end, I'll be exploring the geography of the city one post at time, paying special attention to the processes, relationships, and histories that give shape to this inkblot of a town.

In the coming months, you can expect posts about November’s 10-One council district elections, residential growth and gentrification, Austin’s urban forest, and more. I'll also be using this weblog as a space to experiment with the wealth of open-source web-mapping and visualization frameworks (e.g, D3.js, Geo- and TopoJSON, OpenStreetMap, Leaflet), and to promote open data and open GIS practices more broadly.

Thanks for visiting—and enjoy!

-John
