The choropleth inkblot you see above is Austin, as divided by its [new single-member council districts](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/10-one). The first in a series of forthcoming posts which will examine the demography of the new districts, it was my intention for the map to serve as a lightweight, interactive complement to City Demographer Ryan Robinson’s presentation, available [here](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/10-ONE/Districts10_rev5.pdf) (pdf).

This initial snapshot is limited only to population totals and the racial/ethnic constitutions of each district, which I’ve pulled from the 2012 American Community Survey estimates. If you’re not sure which district you live in, refer to the city’s [district look-up](http://www.austintexas.gov/GIS/CouncilDistrictMap/) tool.

That’s all for now. Stay tuned for forthcoming maps of housing and economic indicators as well.
