So long, WordPress! Largely at the suggestion of [@haileypate](https://twitter.com/haileypate), I've moved [SPATIALAUSTIN](http://spatialaustin.com) to the happy land of [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

What's in it for you? Well, the site loads a lot, lot faster, and the whole thing is [repo'd for your enjoyment](https://github.com/spatialaustin/spatialaustin.github.io).

This process would have been easier if I had been consistent with naming conventions and file structures back when I created the site, but, hey, I am all the wiser now. By the way, I mostly lifted my site design from [@mdo](https://github.com/poole).

Happy surfin'!

-John
