Following up on our look at [building demolitions by council district](http://spatialaustin.github.io/austin-demolished/), we now have a map with which to explore the 5,000 or so demolition permits that have been issued in Austin since 2007.

Click/touch any parcel to view information about what was demolished there. In most cases you should also be able to see a Street View image of the property. Use the time slider to filter by month/year.
